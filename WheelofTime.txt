The Wheel of Time
 - download game from gog or gog galaxy

 - download nGLide (https://www.zeus-software.com/downloads/nglide)
 - go to "C:\Windows\SysWOW64" and put glide.dll, glide2x.gll, glide3x.dll, 3DfxSpl.dll, 3DfxSpl2.dll, 3DfxSpl3.dll, nglide_config.exe, and nglide_readme.txt in "C:\Program Files (x86)\GOG Galaxy\Games\The Wheel of Time\System"
 - run nglide_config.exe and setup

nGlide:
Refresh Rate: 60Hz (fixes water and animations moving too fast)
Vertical Sync: True (fixes water and animations moving too fast)


As with other Unreal Engine 99 games, its supposed to run using Glide, and not Direct3D
