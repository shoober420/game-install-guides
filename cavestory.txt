Cave Story
 - download cave story and nxengine-evo (https://github.com/nxengine/nxengine-evo)
   + code > download .ZIP
 - extract into "C:\"
 - download doukutsu-rs (https://github.com/doukutsu-rs/doukutsu-rs)
 - extract doukutsu-rs into "C:\Cave Story"
 - copy data folder from "C:\Cave Story\NXEngine-Evo-v2.6.5-1-Win64\NXEngine" into "C:\Cave Story"
   + nxengine-evo (nx.exe) is more faithful than doukutsu-rs (doukutsu-rs.x86_64.exe, which is a remake)
   + disable "motion interpolation" and "subpixel scrolling" when using doukutsu-rs

Rave Story (https://forum.cavestory.org/threads/ravestory-v1-62-soundtrack-compiled-in-flac-and-mp3-formats-by-whatthepin.5683/)

nxengine-evo contains original game with original translation
dont use Steam version (cave story+), it uses the new translation and runs at 60fps instead of original 50fps
