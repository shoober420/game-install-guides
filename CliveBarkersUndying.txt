dgVoodoo2 (GLIDE)
 - download (https://github.com/dege-diosg/dgVoodoo2)

 - go to "C:\Windows\SysWOW64" and put glide.dll, glide2x.gll, glide3x.dll, 3DfxSpl.dll, 3DfxSpl2.dll, 3DfxSpl3.dll, nglide_config.exe, nglide_readme.txt in "C:\Program Files (x86)\GOG Galaxy\Games\Clive Barkers Undying\System"
 - run nglide_config.exe and setup



60+ FPS CUTSCENE FIX (DOES NOT FIX FAST WATER ANIMATIONS)
 + NOT RECOMMENDED
 - download HxD (https://mh-nexus.de/en/hxd/)
 - open System/Engine.dll using HxD
 - Search > Find > Hex-values > 0AD7A33B (Line: 0011E730)
 - Change values to "00000000"



VSYNC REQUIRED TO FIX STROBE / RIPPLE FLASHING LIGHTS (LIGHTNING)

60+ BREAKS ANIMATIONS AND CUTSCENES
 - VULKAN: FPSMax=60 RECOMMENDED
 - FRAME RATE LIMITER OR 60Hz+VSYNC ALSO WORKS

As with other Unreal Engine 99 games, its supposed to run using Glide API and not Direct3D

Despite Glide API only supporting 32bit color on the Voodoo 5, nGlide will still render the game in 32bit color, even though you cant select 32bit color in video options

SET FullscreenViewportX AND FullscreenViewportY under [WinDrv.WindowsClient] in WoT.ini FILE

Does NOT support D3D on Windows 11, must use nGlide

USE VULKAN BETA VIDEO DRIVERS FOR NGLIDE
