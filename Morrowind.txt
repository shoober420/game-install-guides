 - be sure to select the Morrowind directory for installation so it doesn't install files in "C:\Program Files (x86)\"
 - for distant land, be sure to click the "Distant land generator wizard" button near the top under the "Distant land" tab
 - don't use "Dynamic solar shadows" under "Distant land" tab, not vanilla as sun shadows are not in original game
 - don't use High quality (exponential) fog under "Distant land" tab, too foggy and not vanilla
 - don't use "High detail actor shadows [buggy]" under "In-Game" tab, renders actor shadows incorrectly by not drawing certain parts
