 - Stretch with GDI: Unticked (keeps original aspect ratio)
 - Nearest: Ticked
 - Progressive: Ticked
 - Drawing Skip: 0
 - Display Skip: 0

Duckstation (MODERN ENHANCEMENTS)

- Rendering:
  + Renderer: Vulkan (keeps PS1 hardware effects like blur for MGS)
  + Internal Resolution: 9x Native (for 4k)
  + Texture Filtering: Nearest-Neighbor
  + Sprite Texture Filtering: Nearest-Neighbor 
  + Dithering: Unscaled
   ++ True Color Rendering disables dithering, effectively removing the PS1's characteristic visual pattern.
   ++ Scaled Dithering scales the dithering pattern to the current resolution, reducing its prominence.
   ++ Unscaled dithering renders the dithering as it appears on the original PS1, which can be sharp and noticeable on modern displays.
  + Aspect Ratio: 4:3
  + Crop: None
  + Scaling: Nearest-Neighbor
  + PGXP Geometry Correction: Unticked
  + Widescreen Rendering: Unticked
